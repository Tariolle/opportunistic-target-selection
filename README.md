# Opportunistic-Adversarial-Attacks

A Rank-Stability Heuristic for Query-Efficient Black-Box Adversarial Attacks

## Overview

**Opportunistic Targeting (OT)** is a lightweight wrapper that adds dynamic target selection to any score-based black-box adversarial attack. It monitors the rank stability of the leading non-true class during an untargeted attack and switches to a targeted objective once a stable candidate emerges. OT requires no architectural modification, no gradient access, and no a priori target-class knowledge.

See [`paper/main.tex`](paper/main.tex) for the full paper.
