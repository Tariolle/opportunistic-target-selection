# Opportunistic Target Selection

Early Directional Commitment for Query-Efficient Black-Box Adversarial Attacks

## Overview

**Opportunistic Target Selection (OTS)** is a lightweight wrapper that adds early target selection to any score-based black-box adversarial attack. It runs the attack in untargeted mode for a short exploration phase, then switches to a targeted objective against whichever non-true class currently leads. By acting as a margin-loss surrogate for attacks that lack implicit target tracking, OTS eliminates class drift without requiring architectural modification, gradient access, or a priori target-class knowledge.

See [`paper/main.tex`](paper/main.tex) for the full paper.
